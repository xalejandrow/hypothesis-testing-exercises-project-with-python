        "Having frequency histograms is a good way of looking at how is our data distributed. But at some point, we might want to see what percentage of our data falls into each of the variable's categories. In that case we can build a relative frequency histogram, which will shows us the percentages instead of the quantities. But as we have more and more data we might want to see smaller bins in our histogram so that we can see the distribution much clear. As we continue having more and more data, maybe we want to see even more thin bins which will get us into a point where we approach to an infiinite number of categories and the best way of looking at it would be to connect the top of the bars that you will actually get a curve. This is called the density curve."

For example, if we wanted to test whether voter age differs based on some categorical variable like race, we have to compare the means of each level or group the variable. We could carry out a separate t-test for each pair of groups, but when you conduct many tests you increase the chances of false positives. The analysis of variance or ANOVA is a statistical inference test that lets you compare multiple groups at the same time.
